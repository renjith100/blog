## Project Overview

[The Vercel Portfolio Starter Kit](https://vercel.com/templates/next.js/portfolio-starter-kit) blogging platform is built with modern web technologies and best practices in mind. It features:
- Static site generation for blazing-fast performance
- MDX support for writing blog posts with JSX components
- Clean and minimalist design
- RSS feed generation
- SEO optimization with meta tags and sitemap
- Type safety with TypeScript

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js 14**: The React framework for production
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better developer experience
- **MDX**: For writing content with JSX components
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling
- **Vercel**: For deployment and hosting

## Project Structure

Let's break down the key directories and files in our project:

```
blog/
├── app/
│   ├── blog/
│   │   ├── [slug]/
│   │   ├── posts/
│   │   ├── page.tsx
│   │   └── utils.ts
│   ├── components/
│   ├── global.css
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   └── page.tsx
├── public/
└── package.json
```

### Key Directories Explained

- `app/`: The main application directory using Next.js 14 App Router
- `app/blog/`: Contains blog-related components and posts
- `app/blog/posts/`: Where all MDX blog posts are stored
- `app/components/`: Reusable React components
- `app/global.css`: Global styles using Tailwind CSS

## Key Features

### 1. MDX Blog Posts

The blog uses MDX for writing posts, which allows you to:
- Write content in Markdown
- Include React components in your posts
- Add custom frontmatter for metadata
- Style content using Tailwind CSS

### 2. Dynamic Routing

The `app/blog/[slug]` directory handles dynamic routing for blog posts. When you create a new MDX file in the `posts` directory, it automatically becomes available as a new route.

### 3. SEO Optimization

The blog includes several SEO features:
- Dynamic meta tags for each page
- Automatic sitemap generation
- RSS feed
- OpenGraph images, title, and description

### 4. Performance
`
The blog is optimized for performance through:
- Static site generation
- Image optimization
- CSS optimization with Tailwind
- Efficient code splitting

## Implementation Details

### Blog Post Structure

Each blog post is an MDX file with frontmatter. Here's an example:

```mdx
---
title: "Your Blog Title"
publishedAt: "2025-01-25"
summary: "A brief summary of your blog post"
---

# Your Content Here

Write your content using Markdown and JSX components.
```

### Reading Blog Posts

The `utils.ts` file in the blog directory handles:
- Reading MDX files
- Parsing frontmatter
- Sorting posts by date
- Generating RSS feed

### Layout and Styling

The blog uses a clean, minimalist design implemented with Tailwind CSS. The main layout is defined in `app/layout.tsx` and includes:
- Navigation
