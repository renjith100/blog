We live in a physical, three-dimensional world filled with objects—some alive, like people and animals, and some inanimate, like stones, chairs, bricks and cups.

Have you ever seen any of these objects move on their own? Of course not. But we humans move things around all the time. We pick up a cup and place it somewhere else. We shift chairs. We build dams and cities. Moving physical objects is something we do countless times a day—effortlessly.

Now think about this: if God had the ability to physically move things in this world, wouldn't we have seen it? He could have stopped car accidents. He could have saved people by moving an object out of the way at the right moment. He could have made sure no airplane ever crashes.

But we don't see that happening. So what does that imply?

It suggests something profound: even an all-powerful God does not have the ability to interact with our world in the way we do. At least not directly. Moving physical things might be a power that belongs only to us, the living beings in this world.

## A World That Moves With Us

If that's true, then there are probably many things God wants to do in this world—but can't do alone. He needs our help.

Let's say God wants to help your aging parents. He might try to do it _through_ you. But if you're not willing or ready, nothing will happen. It's not because God didn't try—it's because you were the only viable medium for that change, and you weren't available.

And life goes on. The world doesn't pause. The show continues, regardless of what happens to your parents, or you.

## You Hold the Power God Doesn't

God might want to make changes to the world—but He can't even move a single cup without you. That's where you come in.

You _can_ move things. You _can_ make changes. You _can_ shape the world.

It's a strange and humbling truth: **you have a power even God doesn't have**—the ability to act in this physical world.

Terrible things happen. Accidents, tragedies, injustices. Not because God doesn't care, but because He cannot intervene directly. Not without us.

So maybe, just maybe, He's trying to make some changes in the world through you right now.

Pay attention to moments where you can make a difference.
