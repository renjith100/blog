This morning, I went out to buy breakfast for my parents and myself. From the moment I hit the starter, the bike sounded strange. I couldn't figure out the issue. Was I just imagining it? It felt real, but I ignored it.

I rode through our main junction—passing right in front of the police station—and finally reached the hotel. After parking, still sitting on my bike, I removed my glasses, the first step before removing  my helmet. Then was the moment of truth when I realized what was happening.

I had left my helmet at home. That was the only reason the bike sounded "weird."

There is a lesson here. When our life feels irritating, or weird, we often blame our environment. We think the world is broken or people are acting strangely. But often, the world hasn't changed—we have. We might be missing our "helmet"—our patience, our sleep, or our usual routine or something else entirely different. Before you try to fix the weird sounding bike, check if you’re wearing your helmet.
